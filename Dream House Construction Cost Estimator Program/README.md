Program: DREAM HOUSE CONSTRUCTION COST ESTIMATOR

Developer: Arisa Nguyen

Date: 2021.10.22

***********DESCRIPTION***********

This program asks users about the attributes of their dream house. It then estimates the total construction costs
based on the user's input. The user also has a chance to enter a budget and make changes to their house 
if they so desire. 

This program do not take into account land, design, pre-existing conditions, or permitting costs. 

I unforunately could not obtain a copy of RSMeans (industry standard publication of average construction costs) to
program the pre-set construction costs. I instead researched average construction costs online. After totalling 
the costs of the user-created house, the program then uses the RSMeans location multiplier (available online) 
to adjust cost based on the city the user chose to build their house in.

All researched components of this program are cited via in-line comments using APA formatting. Full citations are 
located at the bottom of this README.
